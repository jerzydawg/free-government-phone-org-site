          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Emergency Broadband Program Overview</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">The Emergency Broadband Benefit was a temporary program that helped millions of Americans afford internet service during challenging times. While this program has ended, understanding its impact helps you navigate current free internet options available through Free Government Phone and other assistance programs.</p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Many households that benefited from emergency broadband assistance are now seeking alternative ways to stay connected. The good news? Several programs still exist to help eligible families get affordable or free internet access.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What Was the Emergency Broadband Benefit?</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">This federal program provided monthly internet discounts of up to $50 for eligible households. It also offered device discounts for computers and tablets. The program served as a bridge during a critical period when internet access became essential for work, education, and healthcare.</p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Participants received significant monthly savings on their internet bills, making connectivity affordable for low-income families. The program helped students attend virtual classes, workers access remote job opportunities, and families stay connected with healthcare providers.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Program Changes and Current Status</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The Emergency Broadband Benefit transitioned to the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which continued providing internet discounts until funding concluded. This change affected millions of households who relied on government assistance for internet access.</p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">While these specific programs have ended, Free Government Phone continues helping eligible households find connectivity solutions. Many internet providers now offer their own low-income programs, and state-level initiatives provide additional support.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Available Internet Assistance Options</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Several alternatives exist for households seeking free or discounted internet service:</p>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Lifeline Internet Benefits</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Some Lifeline providers offer internet service discounts instead of or in addition to phone service. This program continues serving eligible low-income households with connectivity assistance.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Provider Low-Income Programs</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Major internet companies maintain their own assistance programs offering reduced-price service to qualifying households. These programs often require proof of participation in government assistance programs.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Community resources like libraries, schools, and local organizations also provide free WiFi access. Many municipalities operate public WiFi networks in parks, downtown areas, and community centers.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Steps to Secure Internet Assistance</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Finding current internet assistance requires checking multiple sources. Start by contacting internet providers in your area about low-income programs. Many companies offer discounted service plans for households receiving government benefits.</p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">State broadband offices maintain information about local assistance programs. These offices can connect you with regional initiatives that provide internet access support. Contact your state government website or call their broadband department directly.</p>
