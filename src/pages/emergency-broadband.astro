        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Many families relied on the Emergency Broadband Benefit to stay connected during challenging times. While that specific program has ended, understanding what happened and what options remain available can help you find the internet assistance you need today.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Was the Emergency Broadband Benefit?</h3>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) launched in 2021 as a temporary program providing monthly internet discounts up to $50 for eligible households. This program helped millions of families access broadband during the pandemic when reliable internet became essential for work, school, and healthcare.</p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Eligible households could receive discounts on monthly internet bills, plus a one-time discount of up to $100 toward purchasing a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers. The program required households to meet specific income or program participation requirements.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Transition to ACP and Current Status</h3>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The EBB transitioned to the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in December 2021. The ACP provided similar benefits but with some important changes - the monthly discount amount and eligible device categories were adjusted. Unfortunately, the ACP ended in 2024 due to funding depletion.</p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">However, this doesn't mean all internet assistance disappeared. Several programs continue to help eligible households access affordable communications services, including both internet and phone options through the Free Government Phone program.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Current Free Internet Options Available</h3>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The Lifeline program remains active and continues providing monthly discounts on phone or internet services for qualifying low-income households. While the discount amount is smaller than what EBB and ACP offered, Lifeline provides ongoing monthly assistance rather than temporary emergency funding.</p>
