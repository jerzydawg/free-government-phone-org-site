              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Your household income needs to be at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. For a single person, that means earning $19,683 or less per year. A family of four qualifies with income up to $40,563 annually.

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Don't worry about complex calculations - most people receiving SNAP, Medicaid, or housing assistance automatically qualify for a <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> regardless of their exact income numbers.

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Participation in these federal programs makes you automatically eligible: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Federal Public Housing Assistance, and Veterans Pension programs.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                State-specific programs also count. Each state has additional assistance programs that qualify residents for <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> service, so check with local providers about your specific situation.

                Applications move faster when you have everything ready. Missing paperwork is the most common reason for delays in getting your <strong>Free Government Phone</strong> approved and shipped.
