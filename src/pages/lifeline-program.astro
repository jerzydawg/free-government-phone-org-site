        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Understanding the Lifeline Phone Program</h2>
        <p>Lifeline started as a landline assistance program decades ago but now focuses primarily on wireless service. The program receives funding through the Universal Service Fund, which means participating phone companies help cover the costs.</p>
        
        <p>What makes this different from regular phone plans? Everything is provided at no cost to qualifying customers. Your monthly minutes, text messages, and data allowance are completely free. Many participants save $50-80 per month compared to traditional phone plans.</p>
        
        <p>The program operates nationwide, with approved providers serving both urban and rural areas. Whether you live in a major city or small town, you can likely find a Free Government Phone provider in your area.</p>
